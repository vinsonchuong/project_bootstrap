## Development
### Getting Started
We assume that the following external dependencies are setup and available:
* PostgreSQL
* Ruby 2.1.1
* Bundler
* Zeus

The rest of the dependencies are handled through:
```bash
bundle install
```

Create `.env` with the necessary database credentials:
```bash
POSTGRES_USER='if different from your unix username'
POSTGRES_PASSWORD='unless Postgres authenticates with trust or ident'
```
Then, bootstrap the database with:
```bash
foreman run bundle exec rake db:setup
foreman run bundle exec rake db:test:prepare
```
`foreman run` just sources `.env` before running the given command.

Create a cookie encryption key with:
```bash
echo "SECRET_TOKEN='$(bundle exec rake secret)'" >> .env
```

You should now be able to run the tests and start the application:
```bash
foreman start
```
